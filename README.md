# Non-Contact-AC-Voltage-Detector

 #### Hi, Shubh this side,  I am here to give a bit of description about the project that i made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
ðŸ‘‡

#### Here is diagram of the project by which we could easily understand three transistors are connected together with the negative end of the 9v source.  The positive end is connected to the buzzer as well as the LED(resistor in between). 
#### The coil which you could see is nothing but the copper wire which i have peeled.

 #### What is the purpose of Non Contact AC Voltage Detector ?
 #### --We could easily find if in a board or anywhere else wheater the current is flowing or not, or wheather the thing is working or not without any type of Contact.
 
 .                                                                                                                                                              
 
 
 ## Observation:
#### As i bring the Detector near the electricity board the LED as well as the Buzzer stats working which means it has detected the AC supply. When we take the detector towards the another side it stops working .                                                                                  
                                                                                                 
.                                                                                                 
 
 ## Explanation:

 #### The concept which has been used in the  Non Contact AC Voltage Detector is DARLINGTON PAIR.

#### Through this image we could understand that the amplification occurs as we connect a transistor to another. 

#### The coil connected in the front receives a signal or very small current from the board and transfers it to the transistor. Now the transistors amplifies the signal and forwards it(more the transistors, better the signal) due to which the LED and the Buzzer starts working.

.

## How the coil or antenna draws the current without any contact ? 
#### -- When our coil is brought near to the supply board, coil works as one end of the Capacitor and the other end is in the supply, middle part becomes the capacitance due to which a signal is received and forwarded to the base of the transistor. If we increase the area of the coil better will be the signal received.  
 
 .
 
 

## If we move towards the other side of the hole why the detector stops working ? 
#### -- Because of hole being Neutral the detector dont work and as it move towards the hole of phase line , the detector stars working.
